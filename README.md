# Practicals

You can do the practicals on your own laptop, or else you can create a free account in the Posit Cloud to launch an online version of RStudio [here](https://posit.cloud/).

## Practical 1: Install HADES

Follow these instructions on the HADES website:

1.  [How to set up R](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html) (Note: if you're using the Posit Cloud you can skip most of this, but you'll still need to configure your GitHub Personal Access Token).
2.  [How to install HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/installingHades.html).

## Practical 2: Query the CDM using OHDSI-SQL  

Complete the exercises here:

1.  [Querying the OMOP CDM with OHDSI-SQL](https://ohdsi.github.io/Tutorial-Hades/QueryingUsingOhdsiSql.html)

## Practical 3: Create cohort definitions using Capr

1.  [Building Cohorts with Capr](https://ohdsi.github.io/Tutorial-Hades/CaprExercises.html)

## Practical 4: Design and run a Strategus study

For this you'll need to [download the example database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hH9k0Lf3B8iutQT7U-A5Ii7g9proNWZW/view?usp=sharing). This may take a while, so perhaps best to initiate the download before you take a break.
